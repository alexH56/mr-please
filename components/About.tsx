							There's a duality at the heart of Mr. Please: a band driven by a
							shared love for both the power of a great song and the magic of
							live improvisation.
						</i>
						<p>
							Drawing on a wide range of influences, the group weaves a sonic
							tapestry that defies easy categorization. Blending their funk and
							indie rock foundation with sounds from across the world and back
							again to those of their native Kentucky, their innovative
							songwriting and dynamic performance have earned them spots at
							Summer Camp and Backwoods Music Festivals, along with opening
							slots for acts like SunSquabi and Dizgo.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>In the studio,</b> the five-piece tackles subjects from the
							serious to sexy to the absurd (and sometimes all at once). Not
							content to limit themselves in style or genre, the group's only
							goal is to craft songs with infectious melodies, memorable lyrics,
							and grooves that make you want to ðŸ•º <i>dance</i> ðŸ’ƒ.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>On the stage,</b> this no-holds-barred approach rings twice as
							true. Minor-key electronica over a bluegrass beat? Jazzed-up
							psychedelia on a 90's hip-hop cover? All on the table. The band
							treats their live set as a playground where they expand on their
							songs with jams that evolve every time they play, exchanging
							energy with the audience in a way that leaves no two shows the
							same.
						</p>
						<p>
							In early 2020, the group was formed by a twist of fate. Guitarist
							& vocalist <b>Max Voorhees</b> was living abroad in Asia and,
							while on a visit home to Louisville, gathered friends{' '}
							<b>Ryan Chadwick</b> (drums/vocals), <b>Alex Hamilton</b>{' '}
							(guitar/vocals), and <b>Jarrod McClellan</b> (bass/vocals) for a
							jam session. Days later, all flights back were canceled due to the
							Covid-19 pandemic, and what was supposed to be a one-off jam
							quickly became a serious project. After the world opened back up
							and they began playing shows, the gang soon added{' '}
							<b>Nico Extra</b> (keyboard/vocals) to round out their lineup.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the years since, the band has built a dedicated fanbase as they
							continue to push boundaries and explore new sonic territory. Hot
							on the heels of their debut album <i>Pleasant Tense</i>, Mr.
							Please is hitting the road to build their followingâ€”and
							communityâ€”one jam at a time.
