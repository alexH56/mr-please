              Mr. Please is a genre-defying musical experience from Louisville,
              Kentucky. Drawing on a wide range of influences, from the
              bluegrass of their native Kentucky to psychedelia, funk, and indie
              rock, Mr. Please offers something for everyone with a sound
              uniquely their own.
