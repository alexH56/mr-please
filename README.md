# Mr. Please

Inspired by the likes of [All Things Umphrey's](https://allthings.umphreys.com/) and [Phish.net](https://phish.net/setlists/phish/), this project will serve as a similar utility for my band, Mr. Please. It will store an interactive history of shows and performances, and eventually be part of the greater general website for the group.

The project is currently hosted [here](https://mr-please.herokuapp.com/).

## To-do

* Front-end
    * Add styling with styled-components
    * Build the typical "band website" stuff
    * Add statistics logic and display charts/graphs

* Back-end
    * Create user profiles with OAuth implementation, allowing users to save shows to their history, and leave comments on shows
    * Use additional middleware for logging and error-handling
